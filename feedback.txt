Notes from class:
--------------

- Maybe find out how to do Q9 from the first question.
- Going back to see and then reverting: git checkout [commit SHA]; git checkout master
- For the signal processing task, best to smooth the function first.
    - This is beneficial for general tasks such as minimisation (smooth likelihood before MLE)
    - Or use regularisation to smooth cost function when training a NN.
- Then use filters; savgol_filter or gaussian_filter (best).
    - argrelextrema, find_peaks (best) are useful.
- James then plotted peak-to-peak
    - but you could use find_peak_widths
- After filter, apply a fft (fourier transform)
- Moreover, James tests all of these functions separately first. He will send the solutions on.

- Remember to include prototyping in the coursework; can include this in the report
    - Also with your comments, add things that you learn along the way in writing the code.
    - See how James does this in the solutions.
    - Comment with sources.

- Sudoku:
    - Remember to have a test/dev branch and merge when things work
    - Good idea to implement multiple algorithms, and see if they converge to same answer (maybe?)
    - Or maybe just do the quickest one.
